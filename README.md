Contains solutions to the following:

10. Create a program using a variadic function to print a list of 10 things To Do. [Variadic Functions][Structures]
11. Create a program to output a list of 10 things To Do in JSON format. [Variadic Functions][Structures][JSON]
12. Create a program using a variadic function to output a list of 10 things To Do to a JSON format file. [Variadic Functions][Structures][JSON]
13. Create a console program to read a list of 10 things To Do from a JSON format file and display. [Variadic Functions][Structures][JSON]
14. Write a program to simulate a race condition occurring when one goroutine updates a data variable with odd numbers, while another updates the same data variable with even numbers. After each update , attempt to display the data contained in the data variable to screen. [Goroutines][Concurrency][Race Conditions]
15. Refactor the program created in exercise 14 to use channels, mutexes to synchronise all actions. [Concurrency][Waitgroups][Workerpools][Mutexes]
16. Create a program that prints a list of things To Do and the current status of the To Do item using two goroutines which alternate between To Do Items and To Do statuses [Concurrency][Waitgroups][Workerpools][Mutexes]
17. Create a command line app to manage a To Do list stored in memory. This should enable a user to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a list of To Do items. The list should contain a To Do item and a To Do status. [Structures][Arrays][Variadic Functions]

18. This get a bit more hazy here, I think 18, 19, and 20 are completed by my solution in this directory

Ray Trace. This was just me having some fun with go and trying to model something I've done before
